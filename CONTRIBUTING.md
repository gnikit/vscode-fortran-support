as well as instructions for coding standards and contribution guidelines.

## Setup instructions

First of all, this is a Visual Studio Code extension that uses TypeScript and tools based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with dependencies from npm. So you will need to have Node installed on your `$PATH`.

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a branch
4. Run `npm install`
5. To test the extension run `npm run test:grammar && npm test`
